 STUDENT GRADE GENERATOR. 
 
 It will allow us to get grades by taking in specific subject marks entered by the users. After that it'll calculate the total marks scored and in turn generate the percentage and grade for each student. 

Project Description.

  The program will allow users to enter grades for specific subjects, such as Math, Physics, English, Geography and Chemistry. The program will then calculate the total marks scored and generate the grade for each student as follows:
      
      A > 79
       B > 60 to 79
        C > 59 to 49
         D > 40 to 49
          E > less 40.

Project Setup.

 Start by creating a HTML file. Input the fields for subjects and a button to calculate grades. Create a Javascript file and link it to your HTML file, input the necessary functions that'll help the user interact with the program. Once your program is working create and link your CSS file in order to make it visually appealing.

 SPEED DETECTOR.

 It'll allow us to run the speed of a vehicle and figure out whether the car is driving within or above the speed limit. If it's past the limit, the program will calculate the demerit points for the driver according to the kilometers above the limit and check if the driver's licence should be suspended.

Project Description.

 The program takes the speed of a vehicle keyed in and figures out whether the car is within the speed limit or above. If it's within the limit it'll show a message of acknowlegement. If the vehicle is going above the limit, the program with calculate the number of demerit points, depending on the number of kilometers above the limit.

 Demerit points are calculated by, for every 5km/s above the speed limit, you get 1 demerit point.

 If the driver gets more than 12 demerit points, the license should be suspended.

Project Setup.

 Start by creating a HTML file. Input the fields for the speed and a button to detect the speed. Create a Javascript file and link it to your HTML file, input the necessary functions that'll help the user interact with the program, which will involve taking in the input value and determining whether the car is driving within or above the speed limit. Once your program is working, add the function to calculate demerit points and suspending the drivers license, once you're done create and link your CSS file in order to make it visually appealing.
